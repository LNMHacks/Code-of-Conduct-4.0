# Code of Conduct

Respect everyone. No form of misbehaviour including but not limited to harassment and abuse, is tolerated at LNMHacks. Along with bringing diversity to women, we take care of their safety as well. Every case of any misconduct with any woman present at LNMHacks will be taken very seriously and may include legal actions against the accused.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organisers, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event.

We take care of the rights of each and every individual attending LNMHacks. We expect every individual to agree when asked to restrain from any form of unruly behaviour.

If a participant is found engaging in any harassing activity, appropriate actions will be taken against the offender and they will be ineligible for any form of prizes or perks or refunds, monetary or otherwise.

We value and respect every indivual. If you experience any form of harassing activity, please report it to the LNMHacks team. All forms of assurances will be provided from us in the form of campus security or local law enforcement. We want you to feel safe during your presence at LNMHacks.

Everyone is expected to follow these rules, both at the venue and in online interactions in relation to LNMHacks.
